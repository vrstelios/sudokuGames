# Classic Sudoku
Classic Sudoku is the most popular version of Sudoku. More specifically, Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle. The objective is to fill in all the boxes on the board (9x9) so that each column, each row and each 3x3 box contains all the digits from 1 to 9. However, some boxes are already filled in so that there is only one possible solution.

# Killer Sudoku
Killer Sudoku is a variant of the puzzle that combines elements from Sudoku and Kakuro. Despite its name, Killer Sudoku is easier to solve than the classic Sudoku because it includes mental arithmetic in its boxes. Of course, this also depends on the solver's ability in arithmetic operations.
